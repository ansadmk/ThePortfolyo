# Running a Next.js Website

## Prerequisites
- Node.js version 16 or 14 installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url>

# 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
cd <project_directory>

# 3. Install Dependencies
npm install

# 4. Check Node.js Version
node --version

# 5. Run the Next.js Website
npm run dev

This command will compile your Next.js application and start a development server, usually on port 3000 by default. If port 3000 is already in use, it will automatically pick the next available port (e.g., 3001).
Access the Website

Once the development server is up and running, open your web browser and go to:

arduino

http://localhost:3000

If you're using a port other than 3000, replace it with the appropriate port number.
Development Workflow

Make changes to your Next.js project as needed. The development server will automatically reload the page when you make changes, providing a smooth development experience.
Stop the Server

To stop the development server, you can press Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt where it's running.
Additional Notes

    If you encounter any issues related to Node.js version compatibility, ensure that you're using either version 16 or 14. You may need to manage multiple Node.js versions on your system using tools like nvm (Node Version Manager) or nvm-windows.
    It's recommended to update your project's Node.js version to match the desired version (16 or 14) if you're encountering compatibility issues.

By following these instructions, you should be able to run your Next.js website using Node.js version 16 or 14.
